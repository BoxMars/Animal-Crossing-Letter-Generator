			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>acmail.idreesinc.com (and its related aliases) includes external scripts from Disqus (to enable comments), Microsoft Clarity, and Google Analytics (to monitor users who visit the site). These services use cookies and other methods to track users, though I do not provide any personally identifying information beyond what the services obtain by default. If you wish to opt out of this tracking, enable "Do Not Track" on your browser for Disqus and you can use this extension for Google Analytics. Even better, I would highly recommend installing uBlock Origin to not just prevent tracking on my website but also to prevent even more invasive tracking and advertisements on other websites.</p>
			<p>If you wish for me to delete the personally identifying information recorded by the services used on my website, please email me (Idrees Hassan) and I will use the respective service's GDPR tools.</p>
